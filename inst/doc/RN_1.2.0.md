Summary
========

This is a release with some performance improvements (thanks to Ze Loff) and introducing a more consistent naming convention for all functions. The former function names are still functional but are being deprecated.

Requirements
-----------
- R version 3.1.2 (recommended: latest R version)

New features
----
None.

Changes
------

All function names that consist of several words now separate them with an underscore rather than the former mixture of dots and camelcase; e.g. is.oneOf becomes is_one_of.

The link to the online demo has been removed since that server is being decommissioned. When the transition to the new server is being finalized the link will be available via the soruce server.
