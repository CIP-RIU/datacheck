Description: The package helps to check variables against a
    set of basic rules. A rule file can be accompanied by look-up tables. In
    addition, there are some convenience testing functions that may
    serve also as an example for defining clearer 'data rules' or tests. An
    HTML based user interface facilitates initial exploration of the
    functionality.
